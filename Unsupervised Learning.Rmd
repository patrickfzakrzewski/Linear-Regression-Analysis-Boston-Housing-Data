Principal Components
====================
We will use teh `USArrests` data 9which is in R)
```{r}
dimnames(USArrests)
apply(USArrests,2,mean)
apply(USArrests,2,var)
```

We see that `Assault` has a much larger variance than the other variables. I twould dominate the principal components, so we choose to standardize the variables when we perform PCA

```{r}
pca.out=prcomp(USArrests, scale=TRUE)
pca.out
names(pca.out)
biplot(pca.out, scale=0, cex=.6)
```

K-Means Clustering
===================
K-means works in any dimension, but is most fun to demonstrate in two, because we can plot pictures. 
Let's make some data with clusters. We do this by shifting the means of the points around.
```{r}
set.seed(101)
x=matrix(rnorm(100*2),100,2)
xmean=matrix(rnorm(8,sd=4),4,2)
which=sample(1:4,100,replace=TRUE)
x=x+mean[which,]
